Administrative
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using one of the administrative options (:code:`country`, :code:`first administrative layer` or :code:`second administrative layer`), It will retreive information from the FAO GAUL 2015 GEE dataset. This isnformation will be used along the app to define your AOI

Customs

Several options are availalbe to select custom AOI including : `gee assets`, `draw a shape`, `upload a shapefile`.

.. tip:: 

    :code:`upload a shapelfile` will upload a shapefile that already exist in your SEPAL folder to GEE.
    If you want to us a shapefile that comes from your computer you need to upload it to SEPAL first using the `Vector file manager <https://docs.sepal.io/en/latest/modules/dwn/import_to_gee.html>`_.

    If you're not yet register to Planet please follow our `documentation <https://docs.sepal.io/en/latest/setup/register.html#sign-up-for-planet-lab-data>`_
    
Move to the :code:`retreive images` page by clicking on the button in the drawer. 
There, you'll find an empty map and several field that you need to fill.

Now you can select any mosaic in the mosaic dropdown on top of the map. using the :code:`next` or :code:`prev` button will jump to the next/prev mosaic in the list (they are in chronological order)

Once a mosaic is selected the tool will zoom on your AOI and display it in blue. It will add the Planet Lab grid cells (in gold) that are touching the AOI. Each cell of the grid represents 1 image to download.

Download Data
-------------

Once you are satisfied with your mosaic selection, you can click on the :code:`download image` button. This will launch the downloading process of your images from Planet server to you SEPAL folder. 

The images will be stored in the following folder : :code:`/home/<sepalID>/module_results/planet-order/<aoi_name>/<mosaic_name>/`.

.. tip:: 

    In the parent folder (:code:`/home/<sepalID>/module_results/planet-order/<aoi_name>/`) you will find a .geojson file of the planet grid. This can be useful for other tools. 
    
.. note::

    If the requested image is not available (the grid point to water area, the image was to cloudy so filtered by Planet, you don't have the rights to download it.. etc) the image will fail. 
    If the image already exist in your folder it will be skipped. This behaviour allow you to restart a process if your SEPAL conection crashed without restarting all the downloads.
