"CCDC is a holistic methodological framework that encompasses various "
"aspects of space-borne, multitemporal land mapping and monitoring using "
"multitemporal satellite imagery. The core aspect of the method is a "
"*temporal segmentation* algorithm applied at *pixel-level*. It is "
"furthermore capable of utilizing all available *bands* and derived *band "
"ratios*."

"CCDC is *data agnostic*, meaning any type of multitemporal satellite "

"daily imagery (for the latter, a Planet API key is necessary)."

"The temporal segmentation step starts by fitting a third-order harmonic "
"model to each band of the initial part of the time series. Then, "
"observations are tested against the model for each band selected as a "
"*breakpoint band*. In the event of significant repetitive deviation from "
"the model, a break is flagged. Subsequently, a new segment is initialized"
" for the upcoming observations until the next break is detected."

"A *CCDC asset* retains the information of change(s) occurring for each "

"the model parameters are stored for time series segments in between those"

"consider it as a *condensed, synthetic time series*. By only storing each"
" segment's model parameters, storage needs are drastically reduced, as "
"opposed to storing the full time series. Simultaneously, the possibility "
