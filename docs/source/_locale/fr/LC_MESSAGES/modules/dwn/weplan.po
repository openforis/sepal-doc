msgid "WePlan - Forests is a decision support platform for tropical and subtropical forest ecosystem restoration planning that aims to optimise the benefits arising from forest restoration. A initiative of the International Institute for Sustainability Australia in partnership with the International Institute for Sustainability Rio and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), with the support of Korea Forest Service via the Forest Ecosystem Restoration Initiative (FERI), the project provides quantitative, spatial, evidence-based planning support to developing countries party to the CBD in order to facilitate the realisation of forest restoration pledges and targets."

msgid "WePlan - Forests is a spatially explicit, forest restoration planning tool that uses linear programming to evaluate a range of alternative scenarios for restoration, reporting the benefits, costs and spatial distribution of national restoration priorities for each one. The current version (2.0) considers two objectives: (i) climate change mitigation benefit, estimated as the change in carbon sequestration that would arise from forest restoration, and (ii) biodiversity conservation benefit, estimated as the average reduction in local (national) extinction risk among all forest-associated species. The analysis also considers as constraints the opportunity and implementation costs of forest restoration, accounting for the potential for natural regeneration to reduce implementation costs. Analyses occur at a 1 km^2 resolution on a national basis, for countries containing tropical and subtropical forests within +/- 25 degrees latitude. Scenarios are offered in five levels of restoration targets, ranging from 10 to 50% of the areas available for restoration. All results for WePĺan-Forests and more information about the project, input data and methodology can be found on the `weplan forest platform website <http://weplan-forests.org>`."
