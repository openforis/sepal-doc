msgstr ""

#: ../../source/workflows/nrt.rst:41
msgid "The logic of using a comparison to the modelled value from one year before has some important implications. A typical user of NRT-FDM is usually interested in a monitoring period the spans days to weeks, but not the entire year (the default value of the monitoring period is two months). Changes that happen within the year – but before the monitoring period – would be included. The method therefore introduces a calibration period that directly precedes the monitoring period. Confirmed changes that already happened before or during the calibration period are not included in the final output by default. This is to ensure that the user only receives alerts for changes that happened during the monitoring period. The length of the calibration period is defined by the user (three months by default). The advanced options allow to turn this behaviour off."
