msgid "Direct Drivers Assessment"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/workflows/drivers.rst:6
msgid "This documentation has been produced in the framework of the global project entitled: Assessment of deforestation and forest degradation and related direct drivers using SEPAL, supported by the Central African Forest Initiative `(CAFI) <https://cafi.org>`__. This project, known as the Deforestation and Degradation Drivers (DDD) project is a global methodology developed and piloted in the Central African region. The Congo Basin  area is used as an example but this methodology can be applied to any other geographic area."

#, python-format
msgid "Deforestation and forest degradation (DD) are complex processes that have many underlying causes. A comprehensive understanding of forest conversion to other land uses is instrumental for the development of policies and actions aiming to reduce the loss of forests and its associated carbon emission. It is important to understand recurring patterns and correlations that can help countries tailor their efforts towards reducing forest loss. The causes of deforestation and forest degradation vary both regionally and temporally\\ :footcite:`curtis:2018`.  Different studies refer to agricultural expansion (cropland and pasture) as the largest direct cause of global deforestation\\ :footcite:`fra:2022,gibbs:2010,hosonuma:2012,kissinger:2012,sandker:2017`. Commercial agriculture is estimated to be responsible for around 70-90% of the worldwide deforestation, while in Africa, both commercial and subsistence agriculture may account for similar importance in terms of forest loss, while fuel wood collection, charcoal production, and, to a lesser extent, livestock grazing in forests are the most important drivers of degradation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/workflows/drivers.rst:13
msgid "However, these studies (as well as existing national studies on the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in the Central African region) are generally based on data acquired up to 2014 and do not consider the recent trends in observed tree cover loss. They also do not take into account the importance of the spatial fragmentation of forests and the role played by degradation induced by forest exploitation :footcite:`molinario:2015`. Furthermore, they simplify causes of deforestation into a single driver, which does not adequately reflect the complex local context and interacting causes, decisions that lead to anthropogenic forest disturbance at local scales :footcite:`ferrer-velasco:2020`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/workflows/drivers.rst:15
msgid "These recent trends and the lack of updated studies result in little consensus on the main drivers and agents of forest change at regional scales. There is a pressing need to systematically quantify the direct causes of deforestation and degradation via a systematic and comprehensive approach. An updated assessment should provide validated evidence on the role and weight of different drivers of forest loss and support decision making to address related challenges. A spatially explicit approach should also facilitate the assessment of the efficiency of policies and actions in different contexts. Improved spatial data on deforestation and forest degradation, and an improved understanding of the drivers will support land use planning approaches in two pilot areas where the regional analysis indicated clear opportunity for supporting land use decision making and planning."
msgstr ""

msgid "In this context, FAO has developed a robust methodology to assess the recent trends and drivers of deforestation and forest degradation via collaborative approaches in which national experts, research institutes and civil society work together and join resources and data to reach a common view on the current and future causes and drivers of anthropogenic forest disturbances. These tools generate improved information for decision making and land use planning in the relevant management context."
msgstr ""

msgid "The FAO, in partnership with the Central African Forest Initiative (CAFI), and a coalition of donor and partner countries have developed a global, standard, large-scale methodology to assess forest dynamics using cloud-computing solutions and open-source tools. The approach maps disturbances (both deforestation and degradation) and quantifies the contribution of multiple associated direct drivers. The methodology is used to assess deforestation and forest degradation trends and their associated current and historical direct drivers in six Central Africa countries as part of an international effort to mitigate climate change, support sustainable development goals, and protect biodiversity. The project builds on a collaborative approach, in which national experts, global research institutes and civil society work together, join resources and data to provide technical evidence and reach a common view on the current and historical trends, and direct drivers of forest disturbances."

Next, these products are validated via visual interpretation and the presence of various direct drivers are identified to evaluate the direct causes of disturbance, and interpreted in the context of strategic investments for climate change mitigation and support for national efforts for emissions reduction."
