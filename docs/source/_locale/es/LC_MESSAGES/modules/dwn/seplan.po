"**se.plan** is a spatially explicit online tool designed to support "
"forest restoration planning decisions by restoration stakeholders. It is "
"part of `SEPAL <https://sepal.io/>`_ (System for Earth Observation Data "
"Access, Processing and Analysis for Land Monitoring), a component of UN "
"FAO’s free, open-source software suite, `Open Foris "
"<http://www.openforis.org>`_. It aims to identify locations where the "
"benefits of forest restoration are high relative to restoration costs, "
"subject to biophysical and socioeconomic constraints that users impose to"
" define the areas where restoration is allowable. The computation is "
"performed using cloud-based supercomputing and geospatial datasets from "
"Google Earth Engine available through SEPAL. As a decision-support tool, "
"it is intended to be used in combination with other information users may"
" have that provides greater detail on planning areas and features of "
"those areas that **se.plan** might not adequately include. It offers "
"users the option to replace its built-in data layers, which are based on "
"publicly available global datasets, with users’ own customized layers. "
