"In SEPAL, efficient storage management is crucial due to the limited "
"storage capacity. We highly recommended to regularly audit and clean your"
" storage space to maintain optimal system functionality and your "
"resources under the limits."

"For non-expert users, initiating storage cleanup can seem daunting. It's "
"important to start with directories known for accumulating large files, "
"such as :code:`/var/log` (system logs), :code:`/tmp` (temporary files), "
"and personal directories like :code:`~/Downloads` or "
":code:`~/module_results`. A conservative estimate for high storage usage "
"in these areas can vary depending on individual use cases and system "
"configurations. However, as a general guideline, any single folder "
"occupying more than 1GB of space warrants a closer look, especially if "
"it's not actively used for current projects."

"To make things easier, SEPAL has integrated the command line tool called "
":code:`ncdu` (NCurses Disk Usage), this is a command-line utility that "
"provides a convenient and efficient way to analyze disk usage on the "
"SEPAL environment. It uses a text-based user interface to navigate "
"through directories and view which files and folders are consuming disk "
"space."
