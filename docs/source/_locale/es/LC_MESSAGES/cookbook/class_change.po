msgid "Often, we want to build the class change map between two categorical maps that share the same legend. If the two images are taken at different times, this can help us understand how the vegetation classification has evolved between two dates. It can be tedious to build the new legend (forest -> forest, forest -> urban, etc.) and manually write the rules to identify each class. SEPAL will automatically build the legend of the resulting categorical map from the initial legend and compute all pixels automatically."
