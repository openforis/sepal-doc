"A Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) is a set of satellite images taken "
"of the same scene at different times. A SITS makes use of different "
"satellite sources to obtain a larger data series with a short time "
"interval between two images. In this case, it is fundamental to observe "
"the spatial resolution and registration constraints."

"Satellite observations offer opportunities for understanding how the "
"Earth is changing, determining the causes of these changes and predicting"
" future changes. Remotely sensed data, combined with information from "
"ecosystem models, offer an opportunity for predicting and understanding "
"the behaviour of Earth's ecosystems. Sensors with high spatial and "
"temporal resolutions make the observation of precise spatio-temporal "
"structures in dynamic scenes more accessible. Temporal components "
