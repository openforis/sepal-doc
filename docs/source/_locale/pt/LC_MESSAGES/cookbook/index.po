The recipe can be saved, with the same data recreated on the fly whenever needed or used in further analyses. A recipe is not, in itself, data. Using SEPAL recipes enables documentation of the parameters and steps used to create mosaics, composites, classifications, time series and other datasets or information products. SEPAL recipes, once saved, are available in the SEPAL interface after you sign in to the platform.
