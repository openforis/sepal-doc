msgid "The aim of this stratified sampling design tool is to analyse results from a stratified sampling design that can be used for area estimates by combining a map (used as a stratification of the landscape of interest) with a visual map interpretation of samples to produce an area estimation."

#: ../../source/modules/dwn/sae_analysis.rst:9
msgid "The concept is derived from map accuracy assessment principles. Characterized frequency of errors (i.e. omission and commission) for each map class may be used to compute area estimates and estimate the uncertainties (i.e. confidence intervals) for the areas on each class."
