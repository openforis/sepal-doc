(2015) <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.08.020>`__ used this approach to demonstrate that time series can be decomposed into trend, seasonal, and remainder components and that the time and number of changes can be detected at high temporal resolution (i.e., 16 days), enabling detection of tree cover change and separation from the phenology signal."
