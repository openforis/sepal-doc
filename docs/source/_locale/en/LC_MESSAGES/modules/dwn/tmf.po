"The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre developed this new "
"dataset on forest cover change in tropical moist forests (TMF) using 38 "
"years of Landsat time series. The wall-to-wall maps at 0.09 ha resolution"
" (30m) depict the TMF extent and the related disturbances (deforestation "
"and degradation), and post-deforestation recovery (or forest regrowth) "
"through two complementary thematic layers: a transition map and an annual"
" change collection over the period 1990-2019. Each disturbance "
"(deforestation or degradation) is characterized by its timing and "
"intensity. Deforestation refers to a change in land cover (from forest to"
" non-forested land) when degradation refers to a temporary disturbance in"
" a forest remaining forested such as selective logging, fires and unusual"
" weather events (hurricanes, droughts, blowdown)."
