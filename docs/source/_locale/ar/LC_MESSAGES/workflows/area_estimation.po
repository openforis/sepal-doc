msgid "In this article, you will learn how to perform area estimation for land use/land cover and two-date change detection classifications. We will use sample-based approaches to area estimation. This approach is preferred over pixel-counting methods because all maps have errors (e.g. maps derived from land cover/land use classifications may have errors due to pixel mixing, or noise in the input data). Using pixel-counting methods will produce biased estimates of area; you cannot tell whether these are overestimates or underestimates. Sample-based approaches create unbiased estimates of area and the error associated with your map."

Part of the Open Foris suite of tools, SEPAL was designed by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to aid in remote sensing applications in developing countries. Geoprocessing is possible via Jupyter, JavaScript, R, R Shiny apps, and Rstudio. SEPAL also integrates Collect Earth Online (CEO) and Google Earth Engine (GEE)."

SEPAL was designed to be used in developing countries where internet access is limited and computers are often outdated and inefficient for processing satellite imagery. It achieves this by utilizing a cloud-based supercomputer, which enables users to process, store and interpret large amounts of data. Many more advanced functions than what we will cover here are available in SEPAL for more advanced users."

The full functionality is implemented online; no desktop installation is necessary.

Using manually collected training data, these algorithms can train a classifier, and then use the relationships identified in the training process to classify the rest of the pixels in the map. The selection of image values (e.g. NDVI, elevation, etc.) used to train any statistical model should be well thought out and informed by your knowledge of the phenomenon of interest to classify your data (e.g. by forest, water, clouds, or other)."

The modality for the data collection concerns where the team collects the data, either in the same location or disparate locations (e.g. in a mapathon, the interpreters could be in the same room interpreting the data). If the data collection is set up in disparate locations, modes of communication should be specified to help improve the consistency in the data interpretation.

#~ "It is best to use comments "
