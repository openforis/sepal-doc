msgid "**Natural color: red, green, blue**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:5
msgid ""
"**Description**: Represents the true color of the terrain as human eyes "
"would see it, using the red, green, and blue bands."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:6
msgid ""
"**Usage**: Used for general mapping and visual inspections where true "
"color representation is necessary."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:10
msgid "**False color: nir, red, green**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:9
msgid ""
"**Description**: Uses near-infrared, red, and green bands. Vegetation "
"appears red due to the high reflection of NIR by healthy vegetation, "
"helpful for distinguishing vegetative areas."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:10
msgid ""
"**Usage**: Commonly used in vegetation studies to easily distinguish live"
" green vegetation, which reflects NIR strongly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:14
msgid "**False color: nir, swir1, red**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:13
msgid ""
"**Description**: Combines near-infrared, short-wave infrared, and red "
"bands. This combination is effective in highlighting vegetation and "
"differentiating moisture levels and geological features."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:14
msgid ""
"**Usage**: Useful in geological mapping, vegetation health assessment, "
"and moisture content analysis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:18
msgid "**False color: swir2, nir, red**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:17
msgid ""
"**Description**: Utilizes short-wave infrared, near-infrared, and red "
"bands. It enhances the differentiation between mineral types and can "
"indicate burn severity in post-fire assessments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:18
msgid ""
"**Usage**: Often used in mineralogical mapping, soil and rock "
"differentiation, and detecting burned areas."

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:22
msgid "**False color: swir2, swir1, red**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:21
msgid ""
"**Description**: Involves short-wave infrared bands and red band. This "
"setup enhances geological features and is sensitive to water content and "
"urban areas."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:22
msgid ""
"**Usage**: Ideal for enhanced geological mapping, urban sprawl studies, "
"and discriminating between different water bodies."

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:26
msgid "**False color: swir2, nir, green**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:25
msgid ""
"**Description**: Features short-wave infrared, near-infrared, and green "
"bands. This visualization aids in the analysis of vegetation health and "
"soil/water interactions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:26
msgid ""
"**Usage**: Useful for detailed vegetation health monitoring and "

msgid "**Tasseled cap: brightness, greenness, wetness**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:29
msgid ""
"**Description**: Applies the Tasseled Cap transformation to highlight "
"physical properties of the land surface such as brightness "
"(reflectivity), greenness (vegetation), and wetness (moisture content)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:30
msgid ""
"**Usage**: Extensively used in environmental monitoring, land cover "
"classification, and assessing vegetation and water content dynamics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:33
msgid "**Tasseled cap: fifth, sixth, fourth**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:33
msgid ""
"**Description**: Another Tasseled Cap visualization focusing on the "
"additional components that might reflect other surface properties not "
"captured by the primary three bands."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/feature/visualization.rst:34
msgid ""
"**Usage**: Useful for specialized studies in vegetation dynamics, soil "
"properties, and other environmental monitoring where standard Tasseled "
"Cap indices might need supplementation."
