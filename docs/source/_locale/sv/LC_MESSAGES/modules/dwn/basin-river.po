"The Resilient rivers and basins beta app is a tool that describes forest "
"cover and forest cover change from a watershed perspective by calculating"
" statistics across sub-watersheds and over time. Watersheds of interest "
"will be defined by the upstream basin draining to any given point. All "
"these processes can be conducted directly in your SEPAL instance without "
"the need for any other resources."

"To run this module, we recommend initializing a machine with at least 4GB"
" RAM (a t2 or m2 instance). For more detailed instructions, please refer "

"the app will show up. The module is composed of two main sections: (1) "

"code…) at the bottom and (2) the right side panel where the process and "

"The first input needed is a coordinate pair.  These coordinates will be "
"used to calculate and retrieve all the upstream sub-basins that drain to "
"that point for any given hydroBASIN level. To input coordinates, the "
"module has two options: manual and automatic. Using manual selection, you"
" can directly type the latitude and longitude coordinates.  You can then "
"click :code:`next` and the map will set a blue marker at that point and "
"zoom into the area of interest. To use automatic selection, switch off "
"the manual switch and navigate through the map to find your desired area."
"  Click on the exact spot, usually a river confluence or a bridge but "
"terrestrial areas work as well, and a blue marker will be displayed."

" HydroBASIN levels range from 5 to 12 where higher numbers indicated "

"This product was created to show forest cover change at a global scale "
"based on Landsat imagery. This product has forest change data from the "
"year 2001 to the year 2000 as the baseline. The resilient rivers and "
"basins app will crop and summarize forest cover statistics for each of "
"the forest cover classes at the selected basin scale (HydroBASIN level). "
"To begin, select the start and end year using the sliders. Next, select "
"the forest threshold. Forest threshold determines the level of tree cover"
" required for a pixel in the Hansen product to be classified as forest. "
"Constraining or unbridling the value will have alter the amount of forest"
" cover or forest cover change observed."
